#Experiment_table: returns an experiment for neural networks
#INPUTS:
    #num_students: (list) # of students in data
    #num_tests: (list) # of times each student took the test
    #num_questions: (list) # of questions in an assessment
    #num_networks: (int) # of nns to be tested for each of the above
    #which_dists: (list of strings) the distribution used
#OUTPUTS:
    #raw_df: a df with each neural network training as a row
